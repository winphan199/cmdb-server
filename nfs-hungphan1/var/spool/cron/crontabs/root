# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
# 
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
# 
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').
# 
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
# 
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
# 
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
# 
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
# 
# m h  dom mon dow   command
# Cleanup tmp backups - older than 30 days
33 02 * * 6	find /root/bktmp -maxdepth 2 mtime +30 -name "202*" -exec rm -r {} \; > /dev/null

# Take temporary backup of configuration directories every day, for long term storage once a week
55 02 * * *	/root/sysbk.sh tmp 2>&1 > /dev/null
44 02 * * 6	/root/sysbk.sh perm 2>&1 > /dev/null
